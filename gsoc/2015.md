## The BioJS team

__The BioJS development team is happy to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015.__ We are an international team developing beautiful, interactive and easy-to-share JavaScript applications to visualize biological data on the web. We are looking for excellent students who wish to spend their summer collaborating with us on the projects summarized on this website.

Below, you can enjoy the visual presentation of our students' projects from [GSoC 2014](http://biojs.net/gsoc/2014.html).
