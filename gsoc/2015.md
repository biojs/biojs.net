## The BioJS team

__The BioJS development team is happy to participate in Google Summer of Code for the second time.__ We are an international team developing beautiful, interactive and easy-to-share JavaScript applications for visualization of biological data. This web site gives an overview of project ideas we are offering to students who wish to spend their summer working with us. We are looking for 2 to 3 excellent students for collaboration on the following projects.
