### Students: how to apply?

![Time]({{ gpath }}images/icons/time.png)

#### Start early

Experience from other organisations has shown that the students often make a mistake converting the official 19:00 UTC deadline to their own timezone or have technical problems submitting in Melange during the final few seconds. We very much want to receive your application and don't want you to be disappointed or miss your chance of a great summer! So please remember to submit early and then edit as often as you want before the deadline (27.03, 19:00 UTC).
